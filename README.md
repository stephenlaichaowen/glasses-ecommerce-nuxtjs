# 全視眼睛商城 / Glasses Ecommerce App

> Glasses Ecommerce App

## Notes
- Each route writes title and corresponding tabbar in vuex when page component is created, so when page is refreshed the navbar and tabbar stay active.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
